# Rev-Exp

Rev-Exp is a cash flow management system which helps to keep a track of daily expenses and gives a graphical report of the expenses according to each month and also year.

The project is constructed into two Django Apps

*  webserver

Webserver emulates a file server. Usually this would be a separate project in itself. api is a REST-API that handles application logic and serves JSON at all endpoints.
